# Rust Toolchain Configuration
# https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file
#
# This file pins the Rust version for consistent builds across all environments.
# 
# Usage:
#   - Development: Uses stable channel with fmt/clippy
#   - Nightly features: Uncomment the [toolchain.nightly] section below
#   - CI: Respects this file automatically

[toolchain]
channel = "stable"
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy", "rust-analyzer"]
profile = "default"

# Uncomment for nightly features (e.g., rustfmt unstable options)
# [toolchain]
# channel = "nightly"
# components = ["rustfmt", "clippy", "rust-analyzer", "miri"]
# profile = "default"
